title: Why do we negotiate our salaries?

call-to-action: Tell me why!

A couple of days ago, around 3 in the afternoon, an email was sent to all of the regular employees. Within the email was their new salary _adjusted to inflation_. _Everyone_ was either frustrated, or "I knew it would be this low".

Now, normally, this should be an awesome thing, everyone getting some sort of raise? Sure, why not right? The problem is this "salary adjustment" has been building up since December of 2018. They kept announcing a threefold plan for increasing everyone's salaries.

Let's add some more context.

## What's the threefold plan?
From the announcements it seems to be something like:
1. Increase based on inflation.
2. Get a third party company to review the salaries of everyone, and adjust it according to "market rates".
3. Then, something I can't remember so I'll edit this later unless I forget.

> All the juniors are without a doubt _far below_ from the market's average salary.

On paper, it's a reasonable move for a startup, budget and all that jazz, but the second step will _supposedly_ take effect on 2020. Now, will everyone get to wait _that_ long than to find a different, better paying job?

The day after, our CFO held a brown bag session to re-iterate the plan, and tell everyone that "it's all part of the plan" to improve everything here.

I do believe they're sincere. I don't really want to villianize anyone, we do the best we can with our jobs with constraints we are given. We discussed how to potentially do an adjustment on salaries without having to go out of budget, which I'm very thankful that they're open to discuss with **zero** hostility.

After some time of evaluation and discussion, they ended up saying something like:

> _“They should have negotiated to get a better salary.”_

I never understood that sentiment. How the fuck does a junior or entry level professional negotiate? Even if it's taught at school, the interviewer has interviewed all types of people of all skill levels and know how hits most to make them agree to the lowest offer. I think this is the laziest argument for giving a low salary.

Also, if all our contracts state that salaries can never be discussed, how do these people know much they're really worth? I'm serious.

If a professional worked their whole life working a below market salary, how will they ever even know that they're not paid well, if they can't discuss it?
