This is mostly based on the scope of the projects I've worked on.</mark></p> <h2 id="okay-let-s-set-the-scene"><a href="#okay-let-s-set-the-scene" class="c-anchor">#</a> Okay, let's set the scene</h2> <p>Here in the Philippines, almost every form you'll run into will have a <strong>first</strong>, <strong>middle</strong>, and <strong>last name</strong>. Here's a visual breakdown of my own legal name since the terms for the names will differ from place to place</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/full-name.7ae809ab.jpg" alt="Jose Andres Cruz Gauran"></p> <p>The <strong>middle name</strong> here is my mom's maiden last name. Some friends living in the US told me that there, without this distinction, my middle name would be <strong>Andres</strong> instead of <strong>Cruz</strong>.</p> <p>Here's a fun fact: <mark>plenty of organizations here use the mom's maiden name as a security question for customer verification and some even just ask for the middle name!</mark></p> <p>For more additional context, here are some stuff about the projects I've worked on so you can compare and contrast with what you're working on.</p> <ol><li><p>We don't use the middle name or the mom's maiden name as a verification question.</p></li> <li><p>The most data customer I've worked in is around 5 million rows, so I can't really answer for use cases beyond that.</p></li></ol> <p>With that out of the way, let's get started.</p> <h2 id="the-rationale-for-multiple-name-fields"><a href="#the-rationale-for-multiple-name-fields" class="c-anchor">#</a> The rationale for multiple name fields</h2> <p>These are the most common things I hear from clients whenever this comes up:</p> <ol><li>What if we need analytics based on the first, middle, or last name?</li> <li>What if we need a specific search for the first, middle, or last name?</li> <li>What if we wanted to be more personal by using their first name?</li></ol> <p>Because of these &quot;what-ifs&quot; a lot of systems here are designed where the first, middle, or last names are required. Funnily enough, a lot of developers design it as such even though there's a chunk of users that don't even have middle names here.</p> <p>Let's hit off these points and see what the common responses I usually get.</p> <h3 id="what-if-we-need-to-search-by-the-last-name" class="hanging-punctuation"><a href="#what-if-we-need-to-search-by-the-last-name" class="c-anchor">#</a> “What if we need to <strong>search</strong> by the last name?”</h3> <p>Jose, a part of my first name, is a also a family name here. It's often argued that it saves a lot of time by splitting the names into fields so results won't be as much, or even have results from the first name.</p> <p>While I do understand the sentiment, I think this should be more on improving the search implementation instead of immediately relying on splitting the name into different segments. For these cases, we can do sorting with relevancy. Maybe a left-to-right or right-to-left toggle?</p> <p>There <em>may</em> be some cases that they want to know if there are family members with an account but that might be more of a security issue which is a whole other conversation.</p> <h4 id="but-won-t-that-slow-down-the-search" class="hanging-punctuation"><a href="#but-won-t-that-slow-down-the-search" class="c-anchor">#</a> “But won’t that slow down the search?”</h4> <p>I think we're at a point in tech where pretty small servers can do pretty optimized calculations because of the efficiency of the tools we have. We can still do performant searches in a table with a couple of million of rows.</p> <p>I'll be honest, I've never worked on a project where searching specifically for first and last names has been critical feature. In customer support, the customer provides their full name for verification. Asking for a wildcard search is more of an edge case rather than a common happy path.</p> <p>If it's about budget of implementing a better search, then there are services like Algolia that provide really really amazing search results with large chunks of data.</p> <h3 id="what-if-we-need-analytics-based-on-the-name" class="hanging-punctuation"><a href="#what-if-we-need-analytics-based-on-the-name" class="c-anchor">#</a> “What if we need <strong>analytics</strong> based on the name?”</h3> <p>This gets said more often than it should. Even when the client pulled rank and the name was segmented, we never really did any analytics with the name.</p> <h3 id="what-if-we-wanted-to-be-more-personal-by-using-their-first-name" class="hanging-punctuation"><a href="#what-if-we-wanted-to-be-more-personal-by-using-their-first-name" class="c-anchor">#</a> “What if we wanted to be more personal by using their first name?”</h3> <p>I either get the first part of the name, or add a nickname field in the user's profile. I personally don't really use my legal name. I use <strong>Jaggy</strong> publicly so reading emails that say my legal first name is pretty weird.</p> <p>I think the same goes for a lot of people here. A lot of the people I know have a formal name that they don’t really use, or only use a portion of their “full name”. If that’s the case, then addressing someone with their full first name is still not as personable as people think it really is.</p> <h2 id="let-s-talk-about-accessibility"><a href="#let-s-talk-about-accessibility" class="c-anchor">#</a> Let's talk about accessibility</h2> <p>Even though a lot of the apps will spend its whole life here in the Philippines, it's still likely to have customers that have migrated to this country. Yes, most of the customers will most likely be Filipinos, <mark>but it's not a good enough excuse to design the system in a <em>very</em> specific way.</mark></p> <blockquote><p>Not every culture in the world uses a family name.</p></blockquote> <p>I have a friend from Indonesia who has a lot of problems with local forms here since he didn't really have a first or last name. It's... a name.</p> <h2 id="budget-development-and-maintenance"><a href="#budget-development-and-maintenance" class="c-anchor">#</a> Budget, Development, and Maintenance</h2> <p>I get some comments that if the user-base for the foreign customers is pretty small, it’s pretty fine to not support that specific format ‘cause of the time to implement a better search or something like that might increase the cost of development.</p> <p>While I do understand where that comes from, I really don't think that implementing either is time consuming or complex. In reality, if we're using raw SQL statments, we'll end up with something like this.</p> <div class="language-sql extra-class"><pre class="language-sql"><code><span class="token comment"># Start</span>
