My friend Martin just sent me two links a couple of minutes ago:
- [2020.destroytoday.com](https://2020.destroytoday.com/)
- [Frank Chimero Redesign Blog: The Popeye Moment](https://redesign.frankchimero.com/2019/popeye/)

I want to do the same thing. It's not like anybody really keeps track of my writing, but like the fact that I can keep a public archive of the things I'm working on.

<!-- more -->

Being sent those links gave some sense of relief. I'm not even sure what I was really anxious about to be honest. I'm not prolific enough to be criticised with my design, heck, I'm not even a designer by any definition of it. I don't have any readers on any form of my writing but I guess there's this some sort of weird "normal" that's been set where, aside from a redesign, there also needs to be some sort of writing, study, or something grand to accompany it.

> I think I'll be able to write more.

I guess my writing will be a lot more casual, stream of consciousness, less structured, but hopefully still coherent. If I keep it short and just keep writing, I'm bound to get better, right?... right?

Anyways, if anybody's reading this, thanks! Also, thanks for the links Mart! ðŸ‘‹
