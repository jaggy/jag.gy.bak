Now, prior to this job, I already got <em>way</em> into open source, tooling, and bikeshedding. So for some reason, I got obsessed with building tools.</p> <p>After using Wordpress, I was pretty unhappy with it. The purist little developer me hated everything about it. Using source control with it, syncing data from local to production, its plugin system, and a lot more. Now, one could argue that I just didn’t know how to build Wordpress themes properly, and <em><strong>they’d be right</strong></em>! But that’s not what I want to talk about. What I want to tell you is the story of building a CMS, and failing.</p> <p>These days, I maintain a couple of sites for long term clients and every now and then, I get this itch to just ditch the current CMS I’m using and build my own, fail, and keep using whatever I’m currently using for that project.</p> <p>The funny thing is, for those who don’t know, I worked on Statamic, a flat-file CMS, and I know it’s impossibly difficult to build a CMS but yeah, I’m having that need to build again so yeah, I’ll write about it!</p> <h2 id="building-type"><a href="#building-type" class="c-anchor">#</a> Building Type</h2> <p>I’m most likely gonna fail in building this CMS. Without a doubt, but to be honest, writing a CMS from scratch every now and then really does give me some perspective in tool building. So, let’s build <strong>Type</strong>.</p> <h3 id="we-already-have-a-spec"><a href="#we-already-have-a-spec" class="c-anchor">#</a> We already have a spec</h3> <p>Whenever I want to learn or get better, it’s better to build something that already exists since I don’t really need to ALSO think about a feature set that can make it “disruptive”. It’s more picking and choosing from the features of all the existing CMSes, and figuring out what I want, and how to implement it, which gives me a wider range on what part of development I can get better at.</p> <h3 id="i-already-have-sites-to-try-it-on"><a href="#i-already-have-sites-to-try-it-on" class="c-anchor">#</a> I already have sites to try it on</h3> <p>Since I’m already maintaining a couple of sites, I have access to their front-end assets, which means recreating a site with what I’m building at least gives me a way to compare and contrast the tool and the experience from the original CMS.</p> <h3 id="i-really-want-to-write-about-something"><a href="#i-really-want-to-write-about-something" class="c-anchor">#</a> I really want to write about something</h3> <p>Since I’m already writing on my site, what better way to practice my writing than to just write about the experience in building Type! I’m already writing a lot on Basecamp to show my peers what direction I’m onto, might as well just dump all of it publicly. 🤷‍♀</p> <h2 id="how-does-type-work"><a href="#how-does-type-work" class="c-anchor">#</a> How does Type work?</h2> <p>The initial feature set in my mind are:</p> <ul><li>Headless/API based.</li> <li>I want it to be a Laravel package. Pull it from composer and you can have a CMS without any conflict with your existing project.</li> <li>It’s database driven.</li> <li>Localization.</li> <li>Maybe “multi-tenant”? This one I’m a lot unsure of but handling multiple sites from a single dashboard could be nice.</li> <li>There’s a separate package for the front-end. People can make their own dashboard, but there’s a Nuxt project provided.</li> <li>I want to have extensions through composer. Pulling in a package just works.</li> <li>Schemas are defined by PHP objects, rather than JSON, YAML, or arrays.</li></ul> <p>I’m not sure how to implement some of these so let’s figure it out! Up next would be what we have so far, and open sourcing everything I have on Type right now. 🎉</p></div></div></article></main> <footer class="c-footer l-app__footer [ mt-20 ]"><div class="o-content-container--full"><h4 class="[ text-lg font-script font-normal ]">🌊 Huzah!
