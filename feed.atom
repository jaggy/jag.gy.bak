        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a lot of sites, you can right click (sometimes twice) to see the &quot;Enter in Picture in Picture&quot; option. There are some sites like Netflix or Twtich does some DOM magic to prevent that.
Here's two javascript snippets I paste on the dev console so I can watch while working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Nuxt you can switch layouts in your pages by adding a layout: 'layout-name' property in your page attributes. With projects that have consistent design, only using layouts for well, layouts, this is fine but there can be caveats to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we've started to yet again write another CMS, how do we go about it? In my case, whenever I write any product or package, I tend to start designing the ideal design and start adding in compromises depending on external factors (mostly my own technical knowhow).
So, let's just jump into it and let's build this!]]></summary>

With the projects I work on, I always use a single field for the name.

I usually go for a CMS but markdown-it, the markdown parser Vuepress uses, has an extensive plugin gallery that solves a lot of what I need.
Turns out, Vuepress is not just for building docs anymore!
Here’s how I wrote the theme, plugins I am using, and the two ways I deploy my site, and the gotchas along the way.]]></summary>
