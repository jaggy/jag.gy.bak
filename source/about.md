# About
Hi there, I'm Jaggy! I'm a designer that loves writing, typography, UX, and code too.

I usually work with Laravel projects. I prefer building front-end things in Vanilla JS, Vue.js and sometimes React (_It really just depends_).

These days though, I mostly do UX, web design, and consulting on usability. I'm still not _amazing_ at it but I'm working on it.

## Experience
In between most of these are usually freelancing on small scale web design projects and security auditing.

- I'm currently building up [Artisan Studio](https://artisan.studio). A small product studio here in Manila.
- I previously worked with [Wilderborn](https://wilderborn.com), the creators of [Statamic](https://statamic.com). It's a flat file CMS that's _made_ for developers. Jack and Jason are _the best_! I've learned so much from them.
- Before that, I was at [Code and Theory Manila](http://codeandtheory.com/). Met a lot of awesome people there as well.
- I also worked at Singapore as a CTO of Vertical Software Asia, a startup where we abstracted APIs of ERP systems so our development team won't have to learn every API that our clients have.
- [CreatePH](https://create.ph) is the first company where I first learned to be a designer. I think this is where I _really_ got into typography.
- Finally, my first job was a developer position at [Meteomedia](#). A private weather company based in Switzerland where we translated satellite data into user friendly information.

## Side Projects
- [Compose](https://compose.fm) is a platform for collaboration between composers. _Github for writing_.
- [Type](https://github.com/artisanstudio/type) is a boilerplate for building Wordpress sites that uses Laravel for everything _besides_ the CMS.
- Recreating popular social media sites to use as a reference when I'm doing my mentorships. Here's a couple of ones:
    - [Slack](https://github.com/artisanstudio/slack)
    - [Instagram](https://github.com/jaggy/instagram)
    - [Facebook](https://github.com/jaggy/facebook)

## Besides Career Stuff
If you made it all the way down here, well:
- I study music. I sometimes perform at _really_ small bars if there's no one else more talented is up for the night.
- I _was_ a magician at one point.
- I'm also an amateur electrician. _I break more microcontrollers than I make work_/
- If it wasn't obvious enough, I love the color pink. It's rad. ü§ôüèº
