At the very start of my career as a developer, and a designer, I got the opportunity to work with the most amazing people in the creative industry.

It was difficult to fathon that these handful of people worked with brands, athletes, individuals that are well known throughout the industry. Not just here in the Philippines, but all over the world.

> I wanted that as well.

That started that pursuit of "becoming better".

I was part of this small rag tag team of freelancers but I wanted to have the work they had. I wanted to be _successful_. I wanted to have my out there, wether I internally acknowledged it or not.

I remember moments of being compared to a hotshot name in the industry and I was gushing with glee.

As my career progressed, I kept being compared and compared, and from admiration became competition.

> I competed with a person that didn't know I existed.


## Be Better

With the name and the work that my first job gave me, I wanted to have more. I wanted to be better.

I ate it all up. Longer work hours, all the new design patterns, design trends, articles written by "thought leaders".

What's worse is I justified it all.

I justified it with the future of doing something different when I'm up there. The promise of life becoming a lot easier if I worked that extra hour.

> Work had become the most important thing in my life.

It took a toll. It took a pretty hefty chunk of my physical, and mental health.

## Bad Habits Masquerading as Conveniences

Along with that workaholism, everything came in second.

I started having food delivered because this _thing_ I'm working is *_gonna be big_*.

> It wasn't.

I stayed up for hours to study this new framework to _stay ahead of the game_.

> I didn't.

I had to be efficient in my day to day life so I can churn more hours in work.

> We all know I wasn't.

It came crashing down when I've started rushing in the ER almost every single month.

And for what? Did I get what I sought out to be? Did I cast my shadow to those whom I chased?

> Of course not.

In reality, I'm just a regular person obsessed with whatever the fuck it was.

## Now

I still want to be better, don't get me wrong but I do it one step at a time.

That site I'm working on can wait until I've cooked and finished my meal.

It can wait while I take care of myself.

I don't have to push everything aside anymore.

There aren't any shadows anymore.
