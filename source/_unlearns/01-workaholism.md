There came a point where every single thing about work became the only thing that mattered.

> Work had become more important than life.

**Hustle** was the only thing I knew. Worked myself exhausted just for that chance for the limelight in the industry.

Whether it did or didn't is arguable but it cost me my health.

Before I even knew it, I've developed horrible habits that were masquerading as conveniences in my day to day life.
