# Tools

I want to write mine down too to keep track of how often I switch my toolchain.

## Editor
- I've been using [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) since Februrary 2018. Before that I've used [terminal Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) since 2016.

- From time to time, I still use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)/vim for small edits. It's also faster to drop in a vim config on a server when I'm playing around with some config.
  - I've used vim as my main editor for the past 6 years or so.
  - vim is _amazing_ when paired with [tmux (terminal multiplexer)](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is still my go-to terminal emulator. Although, I'm thinking of switching back to Terminal.app since I don't use vim+tmux.

- I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) when I'm doing some personal writing or note taking. It also supports YAML front matter so drafting from a contract template saves me a lot of time.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my editor for writing public posts. (I don't want to write in iA Writer then _have_ to paste it to the source code after.)

- Mostly, I use the font Iconsolata for writing code. For content heavy editing, I still love Operator Mono.
  - On a side note, in Spacemacs you can use different fonts on different parts of the code, [so the comments are set to Operator Mono and the code is still in Inconsolata](https://d.pr/i/hGbY2P).
- For the theme, I use [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) except for iA Writer. For emacs, there isn't any package for it so I wrote my own ayu theme for there.

## Applications
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is my task launcher. It's also a text expander! I really should start using its workflows though.
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) is my _favorite_ project management app. I can't sing it enough praise on it just helps me get things done! I even migrated my bullet journal to a private project there.
- I do most of my web design work in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
- I was able to snag a lifetime [Droplr](https://www.droplr.com/) account. I've migrated _all_ of my screenshots there.
- [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/) is by far the _best_ media player for macOS.

## Gear
- I use a [Dell 4k P2715Q](#) as my primary display on an open 13" MacBook Pro on the side.
- The [Vortex Pok3r RGBA](#) is 60% mechanical keyboard I've been using almost 3 years now. Perfect for emacs/vim!
